# Team_Utopia_Interactive-CO2-Emission-Dashboard
The primary goal was to create an interactive and visually compelling dashboard that allows users to identify patterns, trends, and key drivers of CO2 emissions from 1750 to 2022. The analysis highlights the largest contributers, examines, emission per capita, and explores the relationship between population size and CO2 levels.
